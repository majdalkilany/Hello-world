# Why Coding 
**We use many different activities in our lives that depend on applications based on programming languages or codes. Whether using the phone, browsing the Internet or when buying and selling. Programming is now running our current world.**


There are some studies that divide people into two types: those who program applications and those who just use it. Here you know that if you do not know how this software works in the first place and how decisions are made through it, then you who live their lives are based on decisions made by these applications and software in order to live on them !!



There are studies that say if your field is in anyone, in engineering or different sciences, then your programming skill makes you work 10 to 100 times faster than those who do not have this skill in the same field. This also gives you the ability to find more creative solutions.



 
Programming is definitely important

Some of the more obvious reasons programming is important are:
- To interact with machines and computers
- To harness the power of computing in all human endeavor
- To automate tasks
- To create intelligent machines
