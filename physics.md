some information about **the theory of relativity**


*  The general theory of relativity (or general relativity for short) is a major building block of modern physics. 
It explains gravity based on the way space can 'curve', or, to put it more accurately, it associates the force of gravity with the changing geometry of space-time.

### Importance of general relativity
The mathematical equations of Einstein's general theory of relativity, tested time and time again, are currently the most accurate way to predict gravitational interactions, replacing those developed by Isaac Newton several centuries prior.

As useful as they are, so far we don't have an equivalent in quantum field theories due to significant incompatibilities. For example, quantum mechanics has ways to take concepts like infinity into account, but if we try to do the same with general relativity, the maths gives rise to predictions that make no sense.

Developing a quantum physics 'version' of general relativity remains an ongoing goal of modern physics.
